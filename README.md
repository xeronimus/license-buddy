# License Buddy

Stay OSS Aware in your projects!


## What?

Lincese Buddy supports you by listing and checking all open source software licenses that you use in your project. 
Currently we support the following dependency management tools:

* npm

We plan to support gradle/maven...


## How?

Include License Buddy in your CI build to 

1. Write a report of used licenses
2. Check against a recommended (opinionated!) list of license. If a license is used that is not whitelisted, fail your build.

For details see the specific implementations...
